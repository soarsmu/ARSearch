Like the title says, i would like to get a thread-safe HashSet using Guava Collections.
Are any available?

==========
This would be the right answer, Using the Sets class from Guava. Anyway the answer from @crhis was good intended.

<pre><code>
<API label="com.google.common.collect.Sets.newSetFromMap">Sets.newSetFromMap</API>(new ConcurrentHashMap());

</code></pre>
