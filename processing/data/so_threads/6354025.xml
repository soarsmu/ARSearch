I am having difficulty make GWT work with Guava. I added <code>guava-r09-gwt.jar</code> to my classpath, and <code></code> (copied from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2005687/guava-libraries-and-gwt">this question</a>) to my <code>*.gwt.xml</code> file. However, I still <API label="">get</API> the following error:


 [ERROR] Line 99: No source code is
  <API label="">available</API> for type
  com.google.gwt.thirdparty.guava.common.collect.Lists;
  did you forget to inherit a required
  module?


The referenced line is:

<pre><code>
List suggs = <API label="com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList">Lists.newArrayList</API>();

</code></pre>

If I try the following <code>inherits</code> tag:

<pre><code>
  

</code></pre>

Then GWT totally fails - going to the app in the browser gives a 404, and no URL appears in Eclipse's development panel.

What am I doing wrong?

==========
You'll notice that <code>com.google.gwt.thirdparty.guava.common.collect.Lists</code> is not actually in the Guava jars. Try instead referencing <code>com.google.common.collect.Lists</code> and you should have some more success.
