In the following example (mockito 1.10.19):
<pre><code>
    MyClass myClass = <API label="org.mockito.Mockito.mock">Mockito.mock</API>(MyClass .class, RETURNS_DEFAULTS);
    String s = <API label="None">myClass.getName</API>();

</code></pre>
Why does this result in <code>s == null</code> rather than an empty String?
It indeed promised <code>null</code> for a String in <a href="https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/1.10.19/org/mockito/internal/stubbing/defaultanswers/ReturnsEmptyValues.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ReturnsEmptyValues</a>. But it seems so obvious to return <code>""</code> that I'm wondering if there is a reason for it not to.
EDIT: updated version to 1.10.19 from 1.8, because no documentation is available anymore for 1.8.

==========
It wasn't thought of at design time and now for stability reason, this behavior didn't change.

There's an non exposed <API label="">answer</API> called <a href="https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/1.10.19/org/mockito/internal/stubbing/defaultanswers/ReturnsMoreEmptyValues.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ReturnsMoreEmptyValues</a> that returns as the type <API label="">name</API> suggests more empty <API label="">values</API>.

You could also take a look at the <a href="https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/1.10.19/org/mockito/Mockito.html#RETURNS_SMART_NULLS" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mockito.RETURNS_SMART_NULLS</a> <API label="">answer</API> that use ReturnsMoreEmptyValues internally and features more interesting debug informations.

Note this links to 1.10.19 version javadoc, however this behavior remains unchanged in version 2.x at the time of this writing.
