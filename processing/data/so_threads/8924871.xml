I was wondering if there is any place where I can find validation methods similar to this one I've created:  

<pre><code>
public static  Boolean checkNullOrNonPositiveArgument(T object) {
    return <API label="None">Boolean.valueOf</API>(object == null || ((Number)object).<API label="None">doubleValue</API>() <= 0f);
}

</code></pre>

Guava or Apache Commons... Any clue?

==========
Speaking as a Guava developer, our policy is that if you really, really want to have null objects floating around -- which you almost certainly shouldn't -- then you should write your own helper methods.
