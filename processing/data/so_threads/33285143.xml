I was working on a unit testing for a <code>Spring MVC</code> controller using <code>TestNG</code> and <code>Mockito</code>. I've included <code>Hamcrest</code> library in the Maven dependencies as shown below. What am I missing here? The error shows up when I use the following two methods:

<pre><code>
org.hamcrest.Matchers.hasSize;
<API label="org.hamcrest.Matchers.is">org.hamcrest.Matchers.is</API>;

</code></pre>

The following are my dependencies:

<pre><code>

   org.testng
    testng
    6.9.4
    test


   org.mockito
    mockito-core
    1.10.8
    test


   org.hamcrest
    hamcrest-library
    1.3
    test


</code></pre>

UPDATE 1:

The problem has been resolved by changing <code>hamcrest-library</code> to <code>hamcrest-all</code>.

<pre><code>
    
        org.hamcrest
        hamcrest-all
        1.3
        test
    

</code></pre>

UPDATE 2:

As per suggested by Tunaki, the better solution would be to exclude the transitive dependency <code>hamcrest-core</code> from <code>mockito</code> library. So the final dependencies should look something like as follows:

<pre><code>

   org.mockito
    mockito-core
    1.10.8
    test
    
        
            org.hamcrest
            hamcrest-core
        
    


   org.hamcrest
    hamcrest-library
    1.3
    test


</code></pre>

==========
There <API label="">is</API> a dependency conflict in your POM:


<code>mockito-core</code> 1.10.8 depends on <code>hamcrest-core</code> 1.1.
<code>hamcrest-library</code> 1.3 depends on <code>hamcrest-core</code> 1.3.


Maven resolves the conflict by selecting version 1.1 (<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Transitive_Dependencies" rel="noreferrer">it <API label="">is</API> declared first and they have equal path</a>).

You are getting this error because <code>hamcrest-library</code> 1.3 references the <code>CombinableMatcher</code> class <a href="https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest/tree/hamcrest-java-1.1/hamcrest-core/src/main/java/org/hamcrest/core" rel="noreferrer">that did <API label="">not</API> exist in version 1.1</a> but <a href="https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest/blob/hamcrest-java-1.3/hamcrest-core/src/main/java/org/hamcrest/core/CombinableMatcher.java" rel="noreferrer">does exist in version 1.3</a>.

If you really depend on Hamcrest 1.3 specific features, you need to exclude <code>hamcrest-core</code> transitive dependency from <code>mockito-core</code> (and hope Hamcrest 1.3 <API label="">is</API> backwards compatible with 1.1). Otherwise, just <API label="">remove</API> <code>hamcrest-library</code> and you will then depend on Hamcrest 1.1.
