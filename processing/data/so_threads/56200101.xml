I am writing some code that needs to work with numeric ranges. I am using Google Guava library; I need some basic operations, like <API label="">union</API> and <API label="">intersection</API>. 

Looking at Google Guava Documentation, <API label="None">intersection</API> between ranges can be easily made with <API label="com.google.common.collect.Range.intersection">range.intersection</API>(range) method, but I can't find any <API label="">union</API> method; the only viable option seems using RangeSet class, but it will bring even more issues: for example, it's not very intuitive to scroll every range in RangeSet...

Is there any way to merge set using Google Guava or other libraries?

It would be ok even to change library, if there are any better/more intuitive option.

==========
<code><API label="None">span</API></code> will take the <API label="">union</API> of two ranges that <API label="">touch</API> each other.

In any other case, you will have to use <code>RangeSet</code>, though it's not very clear to me what's so unintuitive about it.
